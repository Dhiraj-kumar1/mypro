            A student portal is a commonly used phrase to describe the login page where students can provide
            a user name and password to gain access to an education organization's programs and other 
            learning related materials.

            <b>Benefits</b><br>
Using an online portal instead of printing information in booklets saves schools printing and paper costs.
It also benefits the environment by using fewer resources. An online portal makes it easier for students
to access important information from anywhere at any time of day.
